/**
 * Memory Formation Pipeline — Type Definitions
 *
 * The Formation Pipeline is a middleware layer that processes raw memory input
 * before it reaches storeObservation(). It transforms raw data into high-quality,
 * structured memories through three stages: Extract → Resolve → Evaluate.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Each stage has typed input/output
 * - Pipeline produces FormedMemory as its intermediate representation
 * - Supports dual-mode: rules-based (free) + LLM-powered (premium)
 * - Shadow mode: can run alongside existing compact-on-write without side effects
