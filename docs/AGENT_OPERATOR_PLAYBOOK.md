# Memorix Agent Operator Playbook

> Primary operating guide for coding agents that need to install, configure, bind, and use Memorix correctly.

This document is written for AI coding agents, not for human-first browsing. If you are an agent helping a user adopt Memorix, use this file as the execution guide before you attempt installation, integration, or troubleshooting.

---

## 1. What Memorix Is

Memorix is an open-source cross-agent memory layer for coding agents via MCP.

It is designed for software work, not generic chat memory. Its core value is that multiple coding agents and IDEs can share:

- **Observation Memory**: what changed, how something works, gotchas, problem-solution notes
- **Reasoning Memory**: why a decision was made, alternatives, trade-offs, risks
- **Git Memory**: structured engineering truth derived from commits

It supports:

- stdio MCP (`memorix serve`)
- HTTP control plane + dashboard (`memorix serve-http --port 3211`)
- local-first project-scoped memory
- cross-agent recall across Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, OpenCode, Antigravity, and Trae

---

## 2. Operating Principles You Must Respect

### Git is the source of truth for project identity

Memorix is project-scoped by default.

Important:

- `projectRoot` is a **detection anchor**
- Git identity is the **final project identity**

If the workspace is not a Git repository:

- project-safe memory will not bind correctly
- some commands may fail closed
- the right first step is usually:

```bash
git init
```

Do not assume a plain folder path is enough.

### Choose one runtime model intentionally

Use:

```bash
memorix serve
```

when the MCP host launches Memorix directly from the current workspace and stdio transport is enough.

Use:

```bash
memorix serve-http --port 3211
```

when the user wants:

- HTTP MCP transport
- dashboard
- multiple agents or sessions
- team/task/message features
- one shared control-plane process

### In HTTP mode, always bind the project explicitly

At the beginning of a new project session, call:

```json
{
  "agent": "your-agent-name",
  "projectRoot": "ABSOLUTE_WORKSPACE_PATH"
}
```

through `memorix_session_start`.

Do not assume the HTTP connection alone tells Memorix which project the user means.

### Do not confuse project config and global config

Memorix intentionally supports both:

- **project-level** settings and integrations
- **global-level** defaults

Your job as an agent is to choose the smallest scope that matches the user's goal.

---

## 3. Fastest Valid Setup

Use this path when the user wants the quickest possible adoption.

### Step 1. Install Memorix

```bash
npm install -g memorix
```

### Step 2. Ensure the workspace is a Git repo

If not:

```bash
git init
```

### Step 3. Initialize config

```bash
memorix init
```

Memorix uses:

- `memorix.yml` for behavior and project settings
- `.env` for secrets such as API keys

### Step 4. Start stdio MCP mode

```bash
memorix serve
```

### Step 5. Add MCP config to the target client

Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memorix": {
      "command": "memorix",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the best path for:

- one workspace
- one agent/IDE
- quick validation
- minimal moving parts

---

## 4. Full Control-Plane Setup

Use this path when the user wants the full Memorix product model.

### Step 1. Install and initialize

```bash
npm install -g memorix
memorix init
```

### Step 2. Ensure Git identity exists

If needed:

```bash
git init
```

### Step 3. Start HTTP control plane

```bash
memorix serve-http --port 3211
```

Main URLs:

- MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:3211/mcp`
- dashboard: `http://localhost:3211`

### Step 4. Bind each HTTP session explicitly

At session start, call:

```json
{
  "agent": "your-agent-name",
  "projectRoot": "ABSOLUTE_WORKSPACE_PATH"
}
```

through `memorix_session_start`.

This is the right path for:

- dashboard users
- multi-agent workflows
- team/task/message usage
- multiple concurrent sessions
- debugging project binding and config provenance

---

## 5. Agent Decision Tree

Use this routing logic when helping a user.

### If the user says:

- "I just want it working quickly"
- "I only need Cursor / Claude Code / Codex"
- "I don't care about dashboard"

Choose:

- `memorix serve`
- simple stdio MCP config

### If the user says:

- "I want dashboard"
- "I want HTTP MCP"
- "I want multiple agents / IDEs at once"
- "I want team features"

Choose:

- `memorix serve-http --port 3211`
- explicit `memorix_session_start(projectRoot=...)`

### If the user asks for IDE integration files

Use:

```bash
memorix integrate --agent <agent>
```

This is explicit, opt-in generation.

### If the user asks for hooks

Use:

```bash
memorix hooks install --agent <agent>
```

This is also explicit and opt-in.

Do not assume the user wants every supported IDE directory generated.

---

## 6. Generated Dot Directories: What They Mean

Memorix now favors **explicit, per-agent installation**.

That means:

- it does **not** need to spray every supported `.xxx` directory into every repo
- the user or agent can select only the integrations they actually need

Important:

- many `.cursor`, `.windsurf`, `.claude`, `.gemini`, `.opencode`, etc. directories are not arbitrary clutter
- they are often part of the target IDE's own discovery protocol
- do **not** promise that all of them can be physically merged into one folder without breaking host detection

What you can say safely:

- Memorix supports **on-demand generation**
- it does **not** require generating every integration at once
- different hosts still expect their own directory or config path

---

## 7. Hooks vs Integrations

Do not confuse these.

### `memorix integrate`

Purpose:

- generate IDE/agent integration files
- write MCP config, rules, settings, or plugin files for a specific target

Typical use:

```bash
memorix integrate --agent cursor
memorix integrate --agent opencode
memorix integrate --agent gemini-cli
```

### `memorix hooks install`

Purpose:

- install auto-capture hooks for supported agents

Typical use:

```bash
memorix hooks install --agent cursor
memorix hooks install --agent opencode
```

### `memorix git-hook`

Purpose:

- install a post-commit hook in the current Git repo
- automatically ingest commits as Git Memory

Typical use:

```bash
memorix git-hook --force
```

---

## 8. What an Agent Should Do at Session Start

In HTTP control-plane mode:

1. Call `memorix_session_start`
2. Pass:
   - `agent`
   - `projectRoot` = absolute workspace path
3. If project binding fails, stop using project-scoped tools until the path is corrected
4. Then use:
   - `memorix_search`
   - `memorix_detail`
   - `memorix_timeline`
   as needed

In stdio / project-bound mode:

- `projectRoot` is optional if the process is already launched from the correct workspace

---

## 9. Recommended Command Set for Agents

### Core runtime

```bash
memorix serve
memorix serve-http --port 3211
memorix doctor
memorix status
```

### Project setup

```bash
memorix init
memorix integrate --agent <agent>
memorix hooks install --agent <agent>
memorix git-hook --force
```

### Memory operations

Use MCP tools:

- `memorix_store`
- `memorix_search`
- `memorix_detail`
- `memorix_timeline`
- `memorix_resolve`
- `memorix_deduplicate`
- `memorix_store_reasoning`

---

## 10. Installation and Troubleshooting Checklist

If Memorix "doesn't work", check these in order.

### 1. Is the workspace a Git repo?

If not, run:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Is the runtime mode correct?

- stdio MCP client -> `memorix serve`
- HTTP/dashboard/control-plane use case -> `memorix serve-http --port 3211`

### 3. Is the MCP config pointing to the right command?

On Windows, some hosts behave better with `memorix.cmd` than bare `memorix`.

### 4. In HTTP mode, did the session bind with `projectRoot`?

If not, the agent may drift into the wrong project bucket or fail closed.

### 5. Did the user install the integration they actually need?

Use:

```bash
memorix integrate --agent <agent>
memorix hooks install --agent <agent>
```

### 6. Is the generated plugin/hook stale?

OpenCode in particular now supports stale-install detection through:

```bash
memorix hooks status
```

If outdated, re-run:

```bash
memorix hooks install --agent opencode
```

### 7. Are LLM and embedding secrets configured?

Check:

- project `.env`
- user `~/.memorix/.env`
- shell-injected env vars

Use:

```bash
memorix doctor
```

to inspect active runtime status.

---

## 11. What Not to Do

Do not:

- treat `projectRoot` as the final project identity
- assume non-Git folders will behave like stable projects
- mix up stdio and HTTP guidance in the same answer
- promise that all `.xxx` integration directories can be physically merged
- tell users "auto-update is implemented" unless you mean the real wired runtime feature
- rely on stale generated plugin files when diagnosing current behavior

---

## 12. When This Document Should Be Read First

If a user asks any of these:

- "Install Memorix for me"
- "Set up Memorix in Cursor / Claude Code / Codex / Windsurf / OpenCode / Gemini CLI"
- "Why isn't Memorix binding to my project?"
- "Why does it fail in this workspace?"
- "How should I use serve vs serve-http?"
- "What files will this create?"

read this document first, then act.

This playbook is the canonical AI-facing operator guide for installation, project binding, integration, hooks, troubleshooting, and safe usage.
