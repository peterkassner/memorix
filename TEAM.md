# Memorix Team Protocol

Rules for multi-agent coordination via Memorix team tools. All agents sharing a workspace MUST follow this protocol to prevent conflicts and enable structured collaboration.

There are 4 team tools, each with an `action` parameter:

- `team_manage` — action: join / leave / status
- `team_file_lock` — action: lock / unlock / status
- `team_task` — action: create / claim / complete / list
- `team_message` — action: send / broadcast / inbox

## RULE 1: Join on Session Start

At the **beginning of every session**, before any other work:

1. Call `team_manage` with `action: "join"`, a descriptive `name` (format: `{ide}-{role}`, e.g. `windsurf-backend`, `cursor-frontend`), and a short `role`. Include `capabilities` if relevant.
2. Store the returned **agent ID** — you will need it for all subsequent team operations.
3. Call `team_manage` with `action: "status"` to see who else is active. If other agents are present, check their roles and current work to avoid overlap.
4. Call `team_message` with `action: "inbox"` and your agent ID to check for pending messages. Read and act on any unread messages before starting new work.

## RULE 2: Lock Before Edit

Before modifying any file that another agent might also be working on:

1. Call `team_file_lock` with `action: "status"` and the file path to check if it is already locked.
2. If unlocked, call `team_file_lock` with `action: "lock"`, the file path, and your agent ID.
3. If locked by another agent, **do not edit that file**. Either:
   - Work on a different file.
   - Send a `request` message to the lock owner asking them to release it.
   - Wait and re-check later.
4. When you are done editing, call `team_file_lock` with `action: "unlock"` to release the lock.

**Never edit a file locked by another agent.** Lock violations cause merge conflicts and data loss.

Locks auto-expire after 10 minutes. If you hold a lock for extended work, re-lock periodically to refresh the TTL.

## RULE 3: Use Tasks for Work Coordination

When the user assigns work that involves multiple agents or multiple steps:

1. Call `team_task` with `action: "create"` to break the work into discrete tasks with clear descriptions.
2. Use `deps` to declare dependencies between tasks (a task cannot be claimed until its dependencies are completed).
3. Call `team_task` with `action: "claim"` to assign a task to yourself before starting work on it.
4. Call `team_task` with `action: "complete"` and a `result` summary when the task is done.
5. Call `team_task` with `action: "list"` to see overall progress and find available work.

Rules:
- Only claim tasks whose dependencies are all completed.
- Only one agent may claim a given task.
- If you cannot complete a claimed task, leave the team so the task returns to pending and another agent can pick it up.

## RULE 4: Communication Protocol

Use `team_message` with `action: "send"` for direct messages and `action: "broadcast"` for announcements. Message types and their intended use:

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `request` | Ask another agent to do something, release a lock, or provide information. |
| `response` | Reply to a prior request. |
| `info` | Share context: discoveries, status updates, warnings about tricky code. |
| `announcement` | Broadcast to all agents: major state changes, deployment events, breaking changes. |
| `contract` | Propose or agree on a division of work. Both agents should acknowledge. |
| `error` | Report a blocking issue that requires another agent's attention. |

Rules:
- `action: "send"` requires the full UUID of the target agent. Get it from `team_manage` with `action: "status"`.
- Check your inbox (`action: "inbox"`) at least once before starting new work and once before ending a session.
- Keep message content under 10KB. Be concise and actionable.

## RULE 5: Leave on Session End

When the session is ending:

1. Call `team_file_lock` with `action: "unlock"` for every file you have locked, or they will remain locked until TTL expiry (10 min).
2. If you have in-progress tasks you cannot finish, leave them — leaving releases your tasks back to pending.
3. Call `team_manage` with `action: "leave"` and your agent ID. This marks you inactive, releases all your locks, and clears your inbox.

## RULE 6: Conflict Prevention

- **Check before acting.** Always check team status and file lock status before starting work to understand the current state.
- **Communicate before diverging.** If you plan to refactor shared code, broadcast an `announcement` first so other agents can save their work.
- **Respect lock ownership.** The lock holder has exclusive write access. No exceptions.
- **Prefer small, scoped changes.** Large cross-cutting changes increase conflict risk. Coordinate via tasks and messages if a change touches files other agents are working on.
- **Do not duplicate work.** Check the task list before creating new tasks. If a similar task exists, claim it instead of creating a duplicate.
